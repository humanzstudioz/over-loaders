# over-loaders
Animating loaders using only CSS.

This is an easy way to add an overlay spinner on a DOM's object using simple classes. Helpful for showing loading animations while doing some Ajax/Axios/Pub-Sub calls.

## Usage

```css
<div class="over-loaders thin-spinner">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
</div>
```
In the above example `over-loaders` is a global library class, whereas `thin-spinner` class represents the type of the spinner/loader. For now there is only 1 spinner available. Lookin further for your suggestions.
